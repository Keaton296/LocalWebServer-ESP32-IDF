## The Design
<li>The OOP design of the project has been tried to be made similar with Unity's API, though it is nowhere near of Unity's API.
(E.g. There are GameObject,Scene and MonoBehaviour classes inside the project.) <br>
<li>Having said that there is a MonoBehaviour class, therefore a tiny ECS system is made in the project.<br>
<li>The project is documented with comments, feel free to inspect/recommend anything.
